# SETUP

First do 
https://github.com/Jeff848/OrientationProject

Make sure to have node.js installed

In both directories do npm install

To run, do npm start in both the api and photo-app directories
    To have developer debugging mode in the backend, do npm run serverstart instead

If you see TypeError: Failed to Fetch, then the api is not running
